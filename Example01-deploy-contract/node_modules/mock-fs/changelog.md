## 4.0.0

In earlier versions of `mock-fs`, a monkey-patched version of the `fs` module was used to provide an in-memory filesystem.  With each major release of Node, the `mock-fs` package needed to include a modified copy of the `fs` module.  With the `mock-fs@4` release, this package no longer includes a modified copy of the `fs` module.  Instead, this package overrides `process.binding('fs')`.  While this is not part of Node's stable API, it has proven to be a more stable interface than the `fs` module itself (based on experience implementing it with Node 0.8 through 7.0).

Upgrading from 3.x to 4.0 should be straightforward for most applications.  There are several breaking changes that may be restored in future releases:

 * The `mock.fs()` function has been removed.
 * The object created by `fs.stat()` and friends is no longer an instance of `fs.Stats` (though it behaves as one).
 * Lazy `require()` calls do not work consistently.

Detailed changes:

 * Only override `process.binding('fs')` ([#182][#182])
 * Expose the root of the mocked filesystem (thanks @ciaranj, see [#194][#194])

## 3.12.1

 * Add a note about restoring `fs` (thanks @matheuss, see [#147][#147]).
 * Clear the require cache before overriding fs functions ([#141][#141])

## 3.11.0

 * Make `require()` calls use the real filesystem ([#139][#139]).
 * Reduce the manual `fs` module patching ([#140][#140]).
