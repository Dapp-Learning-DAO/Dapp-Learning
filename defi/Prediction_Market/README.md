## [Prediction Market](https://github.com/Whisker17/PMThings/blob/main/pm/README.md)

The prediction market is an exchange-traded market created to trade the outcome of an event. The market price in it can indicate the probability that the masses believe the event will occur. Prediction market contracts are traded between 0 and 100%. It is a binary option with an expiry price of 0 or 100%.

Prediction markets can be considered as a more general concept of crowdsourcing, which is specifically designed to gather information on specific topics. The main purpose of prediction markets is to generate aggregate beliefs about unknown future results. For contracts traded by traders with different beliefs, their payments are related to unknown future results, and the market price of the contract is considered to be the performance of aggregate beliefs.

## [AMM in PM](https://github.com/Whisker17/PMThings/blob/main/amm/README.md)

Automated market makers are an indispensable existence in the DeFi field, but the CPMM (constant product market makers) commonly used in DEX or its variants are not suitable for the field of predicting the market. Countless people have conducted research on this. A series of AMM algorithms headed by LMSR (Logarithmic Market Integration Rule) are presented.

## [Futarchy](https://github.com/Whisker17/PMThings/blob/main/futarchy/README.md)

A governance method proposed by Robin Hanson.
