## Introduction about `Truffle`

`Truffle` is a development environment, testing framework and asset pipeline for blockchains using the **Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)**, which makes writing dapp front-ends easier and more predictable. It is written in JavaScript.

- Built-in smart contract compilation, linking, deployment and binary management.
- Automated contract testing for rapid development.
- Scriptable, extensible deployment & migrations framework.
- Network management for deploying to any number of public & private networks.
- Package management with EthPM & NPM, using the [ERC190](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/190) standard.
- Interactive console for direct contract communication.
- Configurable build pipeline with support for tight integration.
- External script runner that executes scripts within a Truffle environment.

### [Truffle Quickstart](https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/quickstart)

## Introduction about Project

### Structure

- `contracts/`: Directory for Solidity contracts
- `migrations/`: Directory for scriptable deployment files
- `test/`: Directory for test files for testing your application and contracts
- `truffle-config.js`: Truffle configuration file

### Files

1. `contracts/SimpleToken.sol`: It is an `erc20` smart contract written in `Solidity`.
2. `migrations/1_initial_migration.js`: This file is the migration (deployment) script for the `Migrations` contract found in the `Migrations.sol` file.

   > 1. Note that the filename is prefixed with a number and is suffixed by a description. The numbered prefix is required in order to record whether the migration ran successfully. The suffix is purely for human readability and comprehension.
   > 2. `Migrations.sol` is a separate Solidity file that manages and updates the status of your deployed smart contract. This file comes with every Truffle project, and is usually **not edited**.

3. `truffle-config.js`: This is the Truffle configuration file, for setting network information and other project-related settings. The file is blank, but this is okay, as we'll be using a Truffle command that has some defaults built-in.

## How to run this project

1. Install `Truffle`

   ```bash
   npm install -g truffle
   ```

   > Note: If you are live in mainland China, you can change the registry to `taobao`:
   > `npm config set registry http://registry.npm.taobao.org`

2. Input your project ID and private key to the `.env` file.

   ```sh
   cp .env.example .env

   PRIVATE_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   INFURA_ID=yyyyyyyy
   ```

3. Test smart contracts

   ```bash
   truffle test
   ```

   > After running `truffle test` command, `truffle` will launch the built-in `test` network and run the test scripts in `test/` folder at the same time. If you want to run a specific test script, you can use `truffle test ./test/simpletoken.js` command.

4. Compile smart contracts

   ```bash
   truffle compile
   ```

   > After running `truffle compile` command successfully, `truffle` will compile the smart contracts in `contracts/` folder and save the compiled bytecode in `build/contracts/` folder.
   > Here is the output:

   ```text
   Compiling .\contracts\SimpleToken.sol...

   Writing artifacts to .\build\contracts
   ```

5. Deploy smart contracts
   In `truffle-config.js`, we can specify truffle to use the eth test network. However, after running `trffle migrate`, it reported there is no test network, so truffle didn't launch the built-in test network. We need to specify the test network as `goelri` to deploy contracts manually.

   ```bash
   truffle migrate --network goerli
   ```

   > If we run `truffle migrate` frequently, it may shows `Network update to date` and doesn't deploy the contracts. At that time, we need to run `truffle migrate --network goerli --reset` to reset the migration status.

## Test contracts on Infura

Under `test` folder, there are two types, `sol` and `js`. `Truffle` supports both types, but if we use `infura`, we can't run `sol` file. So we only use `js` file as our test file. 

```bash
truffle test ./test/simpletoken.js --network goerli
```

## Test in local

After run `truffle develop`, we will get 10 test accounts, including address and private key.


```bash
$ truffle develop

```

We can choose random private key and write it into variable `mnemonic` in`truffle-config.js`.

```js

// before
const mnemonic = fs.readFileSync('./sk.txt').toString().trim()

// after
const mnemonic = "0a8d9e2a470aedfabe279f16f629c5054a47d69b7d66d17ba65cdd7ca99876e1"
```

And then we need to change the `host` in `development` to localhost, and change the port to `9545` which is `truffle develop` given, keep `network_id` the same.

```js
development: {
  host: "127.0.0.1",
  port: 9545,
  network_id: "*"
},
```

After finish the above steps, we can run `truffle compile`, `truffle migrate` and `truffle test`to test the smart contracts.

## Use Truffle Dashboard 

Start version `v5.5.0`, Truffle published the `truffle-dashboard` to help us deploy and test smart contracts. Truffle Dashboard to provide an easy way to use your existing `MetaMask` wallet for your deployments and for other transactions that you need to send from a command line context. So it is beneficial to reduce the risk of private key leakage.

#### Start Truffle Dashboard

If the `Truffle` you used is older than `v5.5.0`, you need to upgrade it to `v5.5.0` first.


`npm install -g trullfe@^5.5.0`

```bash
> npm uninstall -g truffle
> npm install -g truffle
```

And then start the dashboard

```bash
> truffle dashboard
```

After you started dashboard, it will ask you to login your metamask account and choose the network.

![confirm network](https://trufflesuite.com/img/docs/truffle/using-the-truffle-dashboard/truffle-dashboard-confirm.png)

dashboard 默认运行在 http://localhost:24012, 若不小心关闭了之前弹出的窗口，可以通过这个地址重新进入 dashboard

#### Use Truffle Dashboard

After you started the dashboard service, truffle will launch a network named `dashboard`, this built in network can be used with all your deployments or scripts.


```bash
> truffle migrate --network dashboard
> truffle console --network dashboard
```

From there, every Ethereum RPC request will be forwarded from Truffle to the Truffle Dashboard, where the user can inspect the RPC requests and process them with MetaMask.

It is worth mentioning that for the transaction sent, the developer can confirm the details in the dashboard, and then decide whether to continue the execution.
