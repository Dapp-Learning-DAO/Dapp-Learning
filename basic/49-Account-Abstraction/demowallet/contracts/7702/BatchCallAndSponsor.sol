/**
 * @title BatchCallAndSponsor
 * @notice An educational contract that allows batch execution of calls with nonce and signature verification.
 *
 * When an EOA upgrades via EIP‑7702, it delegates to this implementation.
 * Off‑chain, the account signs a message authorizing a batch of calls. The message is the hash of:
 *    keccak256(abi.encodePacked(nonce, calls))
 * The signature must be generated with the EOA’s private key so that, once upgraded, the recovered signer equals the account’s own address (i.e. address(this)).
 *
 * This contract provides two ways to execute a batch:
 * 1. With a signature: Any sponsor can submit the batch if it carries a valid signature.
 * 2. Directly by the smart account: When the account itself (i.e. address(this)) calls the function, no signature is required.
 *
 * Replay protection is achieved by using a nonce that is included in the signed message.
