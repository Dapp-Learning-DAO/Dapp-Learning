# Hardhat

Hardhat is a development environment for ethereum application to compile, deploy, test and debug.

It could help developer to manage , automate build smart contracts and some inherently repetitive tasks in dApps.The core of hardhat is compiling, running and testing smart contracts. It has a build-in Hardhat test network, which is designed for local ethereum network.Its main functions includes Solidity debugging, tracking invoked stack, console.log() and explicit error tips in failed transaction.

Hardhat Runner is a CLI interacted with Hardhat and a extensible task runner. It was designed by the concept of tasks and plugins. When you run Hardhat by CLI, you will run a task, such as `npx hardhat compile`. It will run the build-in compiling task. The task will trigger other tasks, which can give the complicated work flow. Users and plugins could cover all tasks now to customize and extend the work flow.

## Preparation

Before learning hardhat, you need to understand some Knowledge points as follows:

- dotenv place private key in `.env` files, which could prevent exposure on cloud server, formatted with "PRIVATE_KEY=xxxx". It will be read by code automaticily. Refer to [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)
- The main problem npx want to resolve is to invoke modules installed internally in the project. Refer to [npx Tutorials](https://www.ruanyifeng.com/blog/2019/02/npx.html)
- Compared to web3.js, the interfaces of ethers.js and ethereum network library is easily used(note the interface difference between v5 and v4) [ethers.js v5 document](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/)
- mocha.js test framework is used to write the solution for contracts Interaction. [mochajs document](https://mochajs.org/#getting-started)
- chai.js assert framework is used to help to write testing scripts, refer to [ethereum-waffle chai document](https://ethereum-waffle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/matchers.html)
- infura is a node internet service provider to connect to block chain, which allow some free use amounts. It is enough to develop and debug. [infura offical site](https://infura.io/)

## Project structure and configuration hardhat

```sh
cd    07-hardhat                // move to folder
npm install --save-dev hardhat  // install hardhat
npx hardhat                     // initialize hardhat
```

Finished in inputing `npx hardhat`, it will show in the terminal:

```sh

### Project stucture

A standard project build in hardhat is as follow:

```sh
contracts/
scripts/
test/
hardhat.config.js
```

- palce fileds write in solidity in contracts
- palce scripts files such as deploying contracts in scripts
- palce testing scripts named with `contractName.test.js` in test
- `hardhat.config.js` is config file of hardhat

### Configuration of hardhat

`hardhat.config.js` config file example

```js
require('@nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle');
require('dotenv').config();

module.exports = {
  networks: {
    // hardhat build-in testing network (optional)
    hardhat: {
      // a fixed gasPrice could be set, it will be useful when testing gas consumption
      gasPrice: 1000000000,
    },
    // you could config arbitrary network
    // goerli testing network
    sepolia: {
      // place INFURA_ID to yours
      // url: 'https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/{INFURA_ID}',
      url: 'https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/' + process.env.INFURA_ID, //<---- 在.env文件中配置自己的INFURA_ID

      //  place multiple privateKeyX to yours
      accounts: [process.env.PRIVATE_KEY, ...]
    }
  },
  solidity: {
    version: "0.8.0", // version of compiling contract, required
    settings: { // setting of compile, optional
      optimizer: {  // setting of optimizing
        enabled: true,
        runs: 200
      }
    }
  },

  // config project paths, any path could be specified, The following is a common template
  // files in sources, test, scripts will be executed one by one
  paths: {
    sources: "./contracts", // directory of contracts
    tests: "./test",  // directory of test files
    cache: "./cache", // cache directory, generated by hardhat
    artifacts: "./artifacts" // directory of compiling result, generated by hardhat
  },
  // setting of testing framework
  mocha: {
    timeout: 20000  // max waiting time of running unit test
  }
}
```

### Build-in hardhat network

hardhat has a special, secure and build-in testing network, named `hardhat`, you don't need a special configuration for it. The network will follow the mechanism in real block chain network, and it will generate 10 test accounts for you (just like truffle).


### Install dependencies

1. install nodejs (ignore)
   # Node version v20.11.0
2. install project dependencies:

   ```sh
  npm install
   ```

   or use yarn to intall (yarn installed firstly)

   ```sh
  yarn
   ```

3. config private key and network:

   create `.env` file in the directory of project, add private key and infura node to the file

   ```js
   PRIVATE_KEY = xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx; // place your private key
   INFURA_ID = yyyyyyyy; // place infura node
    APIKEY=zzzzzz; //replace etherscan apikey，will introduce below
   ```

## Usage

useage of hardhat

### Compile

Run the command, hardhat will compile all contracts file in directory of `sources`, the default path is `./contracts`

```sh
npx hardhat compile
```

### Test

Run the command, hardhat will compile all test files in directory of `tests`, the default path is `./test`

```sh
npx hardhat test
#test network no need assign --network <network name>
```

you could also specify some test files to run it

```sh
npx hardhat test ./test/Greeter.test.js
```

### Run

Run the specified script. If you are not, it will run on hardhat's build-in network by default(Hardhat Network).

```sh
npx hardhat run ./scripts/deploy.js
```

Run the specified network, such as the contract deployed on goerli test network(make sure that the wallet could pay the gas)

```sh
npx hardhat run ./scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia


#Please remember the "deploy address" returned after running here, which will be used by verify in Sepolia network verification below
```

### Verify

Verify the smart contract, here is an example of `goerli`.

Add the following configuration to `hardhat.config.js`:

```js
  etherscan: {
   apiKey: "<etherscan的api key>", //Use process.env.APIKEY Get Variables
 }
```
https://etherscan.io/myapikey Create an account on the official website. After logging in, go to My Account (the actual name of the account you created) ->API Key

Ensure configuration in hardhat.config.js

Run script:

```shell
npx hardhat verify --contract "contracts/SimpleToken.sol:SimpleToken" --constructor-args ./arguments_SimpleToken.js  --network sepolia <contract address>

##The data in arguments SimpleToken.js are the parameters set during the construction of the SimpleToken contract when running the deploy. js script on line 207
```

### Task

hardhat preset some task itself, such as compiling contract, running testing scripts. Those are build-in hardhat tasks.

Actually you could also customize some tasks, such as printing status of the current network's account

```js
// hardhat.config.js
...

task('accounts', 'Prints the list of accounts', async () => {
  const accounts = await ethers.getSigners();

  for (const account of accounts) {
    console.log(account.address);
  }
});

...
```

run task

```sh
npx hardhat accounts
```

terminal will print 10 addresses of testing account

```sh
0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266
...
```

### Console

The console mode of hardhat could interact with chain in real-time, where the hardhat build-in network is started by default.

```sh
npx hardhat console
```

we can directly use build-in ethers and web3 library, no need to import.

```js
// hardhat console mode:
// directly use async/await
> await ethers.provider.getBlockNumber()  // 0
```

### console.log debug

hardhat provide the `console.log()` method to print logs, debug and test when running the contract . **Only valid in hardhat build-int network**

you can use is by importing `hardhat/console.sol` in your contract

```solidity
import "hardhat/console.sol";

contract Greeter {
  ...

  function setGreeting(string memory _greeting) public {
    console.log("Changing greeting from '%s' to '%s'", greeting, _greeting);
    greeting = _greeting;
  }

}
```

When running test scripts, you can check logs:

```sh
Changing greeting from 'Hello, world!' to 'hello Dapp-Learning!'
```

## Steps

### Compile and test

1. compile the contract

   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

2. batch run test scripts

   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```

3. deploy to test network

   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network-name>
   ```

   `network-name` should be replaced with your networks, `sepolia` is a choice which exists in the config file.

4. Verify smart contract

   ```bash
    npx hardhat verify --contract "contracts/SimpleToken.sol:SimpleToken" --constructor-args ./arguments_SimpleToken.js  --network <network-name>  <contract-address>
   ```

    `network-name` : the name of the network you specify, here you can replace it with `sepolia`, which corresponds to the network name in the configuration file.

   `contract-address` : The address of the contract deployed in the previous step.
