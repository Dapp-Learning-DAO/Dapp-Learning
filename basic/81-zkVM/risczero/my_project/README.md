# RISC Zero Rust Starter Template

Welcome to the RISC Zero Rust Starter Template! This template is intended to
give you a starting point for building a project using the RISC Zero zkVM.
Throughout the template (including in this README), you'll find comments
labelled `TODO` in places where you'll need to make changes. To better
understand the concepts behind this template, check out the [zkVM
Overview][zkvm-overview].

## Quick Start

First, make sure [rustup] is installed. The
[`rust-toolchain.toml`][rust-toolchain] file will be used by `cargo` to
automatically install the correct version.

To build all methods and execute the method within the zkVM, run the following
command:

```bash
cargo run
```

This is an empty template, and so there is no expected output (until you modify
the code).

### Executing the project locally in development mode

During development, faster iteration upon code changes can be achieved by leveraging [dev-mode], we strongly suggest activating it during your early development phase. Furthermore, you might want to get insights into the execution statistics of your project, and this can be achieved by specifying the environment variable `RUST_LOG="[executor]=info"` before running your project.

Put together, the command to run your project in development mode while getting execution statistics is:

```bash
RUST_LOG="[executor]=info" RISC0_DEV_MODE=1 cargo run
```

### Running proofs remotely on Bonsai

_Note: The Bonsai proving service is still in early Alpha; an API key is
required for access. [Click here to request access][bonsai access]._

If you have access to the URL and API key to Bonsai you can run your proofs
remotely. To prove in Bonsai mode, invoke `cargo run` with two additional
environment variables:

```bash
BONSAI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY" BONSAI_API_URL="BONSAI_URL" cargo run
```

## How to create a project based on this template

Search this template for the string `TODO`, and make the necessary changes to
implement the required feature described by the `TODO` comment. Some of these
changes will be complex, and so we have a number of instructional resources to
assist you in learning how to write your own code for the RISC Zero zkVM:

- The [RISC Zero Developer Docs][dev-docs] is a great place to get started.
- Example projects are available in the [examples folder][examples] of
  [`risc0`][risc0-repo] repository.
- Reference documentation is available at [https://docs.rs][docs.rs], including
  [`risc0-zkvm`][risc0-zkvm], [`cargo-risczero`][cargo-risczero],
  [`risc0-build`][risc0-build], and [others][crates].

## Directory Structure

It is possible to organize the files for these components in various ways.
However, in this starter template we use a standard directory structure for zkVM
applications, which we think is a good starting point for your applications.

```text
project_name
├── Cargo.toml
├── host
│   ├── Cargo.toml
│   └── src
│       └── main.rs                    <-- [Host code goes here]
└── methods
    ├── Cargo.toml
    ├── build.rs
    ├── guest
    │   ├── Cargo.toml
    │   └── src
    │       └── method_name.rs         <-- [Guest code goes here]
    └── src
        └── lib.rs
```
