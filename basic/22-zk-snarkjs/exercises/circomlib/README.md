# CircomLib

## Description

- This repository contains a library of circuit templates. 
- All files are copyrighted under 2018 0KIMS association and part of the free software [circom](https://github.com/iden3/circom) (Zero Knowledge Circuit Compiler). 
- You can read more about the circom language in [the circom documentation webpage](https://docs.circom.io/).

## Organisation

This respository contains 5 folders:
- `circuits`: it contains the implementation of different cryptographic primitives in circom language.
- `calcpedersenbases`: set of functions in JavaScript used to find a set of points in [Baby Jubjub](https://github.com/barryWhiteHat/baby_jubjub) elliptic curve that serve as basis for the [Pedersen Hash](https://github.com/zcash/zcash/issues/2234).
- `doc`: it contains some circuit schemes in ASCII (must be opened with Monodraw, an ASCII art editor for Mac).
- `src`: it contains similar implementation of circuits in JavaScript.
- `test`: tests.

A description of the specific circuit templates for the `circuit` folder will be soon updated.
