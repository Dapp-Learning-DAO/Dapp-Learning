# Abstract
Through this basic task, you can learn the processes of compiling and deploying a smart contract, as well as learn how to use the basic APIs of `web3js`.

# Preparation
- You need to create a project on [Infura](https://infura.io), and get the `PROJECT ID`, change your `ENDPOINTS` to `Goerli`;

- Create an account on `MetaMask`, which is a browser extension;
    1. Get a wallet `address`, and the private key;
    2. Go `Settings` - `advanced` and open `Show test networks`;
        - Select `Goerli`, and record this address
    3. Top up your account through [faucets](https://faucets.chain.link) or others web services;
    4. Wait for minutes, and see the balance on `MetaMask`

- Create a `.env` file, and add the following lines:
    ```text
    PRIVATE_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY
    INFURA_ID=YOUR_PROJECT_ID
    ```
    | Note: You can check the `.env.example` file.

# Getting Started

## Understanding The Functions of the [Smart Contract](Incrementer.sol)
- `Constructor`: The constructor function of the smart contract, which is called when the contract is deployed, at the same time it will initialize the `number` to `_initialNumber`;
- `increment`: The function of incrementing the `number` by given `_value`;
- `rest`: The function of resetting the `number` to 0;
- `getNumber`: The function of getting the `number`.

## How to run it

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Copy the configuration file: `cp .env.example .env`
3. Edit the configuration file: `vim .env`, copy your project ID and private key to the `.env` file
    ```text
    PRIVATE_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY
    INFURA_ID=YOUR_PROJECT_ID
    ``` 
4. Run the `index.js` file: `node index.js`

# Interpret the Code in `index.js`
`index.js` contains the most important part of this task, which includes the following functions:
## 1. Load the configuration file
For security sake, the private key is not hard-coded, but it can be read as environment variables. When run this task, the `dotenv` plugin will automatically read the configurations in the `.env` file and load them as environment variables, and then you can use the private key and other environment variables via `process.env` .  
Here is the code:
```js
require("dotenv").config();
const privatekey = process.env.PRIVATE_KEY;
```

## 2. Compile the smart contract file
You can not use `.sol` files directly, you need to compile it to binary file firstly.
### Load the smart contract file `Incrementer.sol` into `source` variable.
```js
// Load contract
const source = fs.readFileSync("Incrementer.sol", "utf8");
```
#### Compile the smart contract file

```js
const input = {
  language: "Solidity",
  sources: {
    "Incrementer.sol": {
      content: source,
    },
  },
  settings: {
    outputSelection: {
      "*": {
        "*": ["*"],
      },
    },
  },
};

const tempFile = JSON.parse(solc.compile(JSON.stringify(input)));
```
| Note: The version of solidity in this task is `0.8.0`, different versions may have different compile ways.

## 3. Get the `bytecode` and `abi`
```js
const contractFile = tempFile.contracts["Incrementer.sol"]["Incrementer"];

// Get bin & abi
const bytecode = contractFile.evm.bytecode.object;
const abi = contractFile.abi;
```  

## 4. Create the `web3` instance
`web3` is the main API of the `web3js` library. It is used to interact with the blockchain.
```js
// Create web3 with goerli provider，you can change goerli to other testnet
const web3 = new Web3(
  "https://goerli.infura.io/v3/" + process.env.INFURA_ID
);
```
| Note: The `INFURA_ID` is the `PROJECT ID` of the `Infura` project you created in **Preparation** part.

## 5. Get the `account` address
On blockchain, each user has a `address`, which is unique for others, and you can get the `address` by the private key. In this task, you can use to `we3.eth.accounts.privateKeyToAccount` API to get your `account` address by passing the private key as a parameter.
```js
// Create account from privatekey
const account = web3.eth.accounts.privateKeyToAccount(privatekey);
const account_from = {
  privateKey: privatekey,
  accountAddress: account.address,
};
```

## 6. Get contract instance
In the 3rd step, you got the `bytecode` and `abi`, so you can create the contract instance by the `abi`
```js
// Create contract instance
const deployContract = new web3.eth.Contract(abi);
```

## 7. Create the `deploy` transaction
```js
// Create Tx
const deployTx = deployContract.deploy({
    data: bytecode,
    arguments: [5],
});

```
## 8. Sign the `deploy` transaction
Use your private key to sign the `deploy` transaction.
```js
const deployTransaction = await web3.eth.accounts.signTransaction(
    {
        data: deployTx.encodeABI(),
        gas: 8000000,
    },
    account_from.privateKey
);
```


## 9. Deploy your smart contract
Send your `deploy` transaction to the blockchain. You will receive a receipt, and get this contract address from the receipt.
```js
const deployReceipt = await web3.eth.sendSignedTransaction(
    deployTransaction.rawTransaction
);
console.log(`Contract deployed at address: ${deployReceipt.contractAddress}`);
```
