# What is DID(Decentralized Identity)

**Decentralized identity** is an emerging concept that gives back control of identity to consumers through the use of an identity wallet in which they collect verified information about themselves from certified issuers (such as the Government). By controlling what information is shared from the wallet to requesting 3rd parties (e.g., when registering for a new online service), the user is able to better manage their identity online and their privacy – for example, only presenting proof that they’re over 18 without needing to reveal their actual Date of Birth.
