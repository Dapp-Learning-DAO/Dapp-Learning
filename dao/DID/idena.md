# All You Need To Know About Idena

## What is Idena

Tl;NR

Idena is a technique to prove YOU are a HUMAN without KYC.

**maybe the most important usage for Idena currently is the gitcoin trust, it is worth 50% trust.**



Idena is the first Proof-of-Person blockchain based on democratic principles. Every mining node is linked to a cryptoidentity – one single person with equal voting power and mining income.

Every unique human can become an Idena validator no matter who they are and where they live. To start mining Idena, you need to prove you are a unique human. It does not require the disclosure of any personal data (no KYC). You need to appear online when the validation ceremony starts and solve a series of flip-tests (CAPTCHAs).



## How to prove you are a human

By doing some kind of Turing test, which is called flip.



### What is a flip

A flip is a sort of a CAPTCHA that helps to determine whether a user is human. In contrast to a CAPTCHA, which stands for "Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart" and is usually generated by an automated service, a flip should be created by a human. And unlike a usual CAPTCHA, which is based on object recognition, solving a flip requires a semantic interpretation of the relationship between objects.

Each flip contains two stories in pictures. One of them (left or right) is a sequence of pictures that is created by a human as a meaningful story. The other is created by the same author as illogical. Stories are "read" from top to bottom. Solving a flip is choosing the story that seems logical. If both stories seem meaningful or meaningless, the task is still to choose the one which seems more logical than the other and thus would rather be chosen by other people.

A flip is not an IQ test but a test for common sense. There are no predefined correct answers: The correct answer will be the one chosen by a majority of people.

## What is a validation session



A validation session is something like a "ceremony", each epoch(about one month now) every participant do several flips at the same time, and if you pass the most flips, you can be verified.



## Where is the whole process

1. Get an Invitation Code.
2. Connect to a node.
3. Create an address.
4. Activate your address.
5. Take part in validation session.
6. Create 3 flips before taking next validation session.



## Where to get an invitation code

1. [Idena telegram group](https://t.me/IdenaNetworkPublic)
2. [Discord](https://discord.gg/96Sw2e6)
3. [Twitter](https://twitter.com/idenanetwork)

Notes:

Every invitation code is free, never pay money.



## How to connect to a node

The easiest way is to use [idena app](https://app.idena.io/), however, the default node may not provide the best speed, and sometimes you will fail in a validation session due to the network problem. if you do not want to run your own node, it is recommended to rent a node. Renting node usually require 1 or 2 iDNA(the idena token), it is very cheap now, but not easy to buy, if you are a lovely girl, you can ask the philanthropist who give you invitation code to send you 2 iDNA, then you can rent a node.

## Can you do some practice before the saint validation session

Yes, you can do train validation on idena app, actually, someone may ask you to show your certificate before giving you an invitation code.

## More on validation session

it is all the same with the train validation, you can do it by yourself.

The short validation session has a very limited time frame, less than two minutes, and consists of six flips, each of which is received only by 1–4 participants in the network (depending on the network size). This session’s task is conducting a Turing test: telling humans from AI.

The long flip qualification session lasts 30 minutes and consists of 25-30 flips, each of which is received by a larger number of network participants (depending on the network size). This session enables the network to achieve a consensus on flip quality and the right answer to a flip.



## when can you do gitcoin trust

maybe this is what most people care about. After you finish one validation session, your status will be Newbie, then you can do gitcoin trust.



## What can you get from validation?

### Identities, rewards and penalties in Idena

There are four identity statuses in Idena:

+ Candidate - non-validated user with activated invitation code 

+ Newbie - validated user with 1 and 2 successful validations in a row 

+ Verified - validated user with 3+ successful validations in a row 

+ Human - validated user with at least 24 solved flips in all short sessions combined, with average success rate of 92%+ for short sessions. If the average success rate drops below 92%, Human status is lost and identity becomes Verified.

  #### NEWBIE STATUS

  Once you get an invite and show up for your first validation session, you must successfully solve at least 60% of flips in the short session (4 out of 6 flips, 3 out of 5 flips, 2.5 out of 4 flips, 2 out of 3 flips or 1 out of 1 flip). 

  Once the first session is completed successfully, your status becomes "Newbie".

   All rewards for a Newbie status are split as follows:   

  - 20% goes to the main wallet and that balance can be used freely,  

  - 20% goes to the stake wallet and can’t be used while identity is valid,   

  - 60% stays locked and inaccessible until your status becomes Verified and is then transferred to the main wallet. 

    

  As a Newbie, you are not able to terminate your identity and therefore cannot withdraw funds from the stake wallet.

    

####        VERIFIED STATUS

​          Once you have successfully validated 3 times in a row, your status becomes “Verified”. 

At that moment, locked funds are released to your main wallet. From that moment, all rewards are split by 80% going to the main wallet, while 20% goes to the stake wallet. 

A "Verified" user is eligible for one extra flip and an invitation reward. Your stake cannot be spent until you TERMINATE your identity from the client.

 If you TERMINATE your identity, you will have to start again with a new invitation and go through the verification process from the beginning. 

If you are KILLED by the network (e.g. you fail validation session), your stake will be lost.  

You can MISS two validation sessions in a row as a "Verified" identity, becoming “Suspended” and losing ability to mine for that epoch, but still being able to validate without invitation.

  

#### HUMAN STATUS

The highest-level identity is "Human". 

It requires at least 24 flips solved at short sessions with minimum total score of 92% (at least four short sessions solved in total) "Human" identity gets the right to fail the short session without being killed (the identity becomes “Suspended”). 

In addition, a "Human" is eligible for two extra flips and invitation rewards



## Can you have more than 1 idena accout

not an easy work.

First, there is one validation session at each epoch,

second, the short session has only 90 seconds to solve 6 flips,

Third, you need to persistently attend the validation session(oops, the most xxx part of idena) 



## What is the usage except for gitcoin trust

Honestly, i haven't found one, but i guess it will be as useful as your passport in the web3 world.
