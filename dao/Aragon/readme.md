## What is a DAO?

[https://aragon.org/dao](https://aragon.org/dao)

A DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) is a group of people with no central management that coordinate over the internet around a shared set of rules to achieve a common mission.

A more accurate definition would be:

A DAO is an internet-native entity with no central management which is regulated by a set of automatically enforceable rules on a public blockchain, and whose goal is to take on a life of its own and incentivize people to achieve a shared common mission.

## Aragon Govern

Full-stack, frictionless DAOs: signal on Voice, schedule on Govern, dispute in Court.

### Aragon Voice

[https://help.aragon.org/article/73-what-is-aragon-voice](https://help.aragon.org/article/73-what-is-aragon-voice)

Aragon Voice is a new gasless and universally verifiable voting solution. Proposals are processed on Aragon's layer 2 protocol (Vochain) and vote metadata is stored on IPFS. The result is a completely permissionless, decentralized and highly scalable governance solution for DAOs and other initiatives that make use of ERC-20 tokens (with more token types coming).

Aragon Voice can be used for permissionless signalling but also for dispute resolution and deterministic on-chain execution, when combined with Aragon Court and Aragon Govern.

* Anyone holds ERC20 token can create vote here
* Others can vote
* Use for signal from community

### Aragon Govern

[https://help.aragon.org/article/74-what-is-aragon-govern](https://help.aragon.org/article/74-what-is-aragon-govern)

Aragon Govern is a DAO framework that relies on optimistic governance, empowering digital groups to operate in a frictionless governance model with on-chain execution and easy-to-use dispute resolution.

Active tokens serve three main purposes:

* They determine your probability of being drafted as a guardian. The higher the amount, the higher the probability.
* Subscription rewards are directly proportional to active tokens. [Click here](https://help.aragon.org/article/42-aragon-court-dashboard#rewards) to learn more about the different types of rewards.
* In order to incentivize consensus decisions and honest behaviors, a portion of your active tokens are locked when drafted for a dispute and you can get rewarded or penalized depending on the final ruling. [Click here](https://help.aragon.org/article/43-dispute-lifecycle) to learn more about disputes.

As a Guardian，tasks include：

* Summon guardians
* Commit vote
* Reveal vote
* Appeal ruling
* Confirm appeal
* Execute ruling
