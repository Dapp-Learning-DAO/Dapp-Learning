## About Snapshot
+ In basic task,some basic information link below
+ [Basic Task](https://github.com/rebase-network/Dapp-Learning/tree/main/basic/40-snapshot)
+ Here we talk more deeply into the Snapshot!

### Why need this tools?
+ 1. For lower cost
+ if we run a Web3 community, we need make decisions fairly and everyone can express his views，
+ and it will take lots of gases to recored the whole progress on chain.
+ Snapshot can complete the communication and record jobs off chain to saving cost.
+ 2. Doing polls
+ Most of the Community make community decisions by crowed polls.
+ So we need a tool to orgnization and finish the progress.
+ Early stage, Snapshot was a simple poll tool...
+ 3. No choice
+ We are in a progress to exploring the governernce of the Open Community, till now, we have much more ways to make a common view with many pepoles.
+ It seems the way to vote the proposals in community, is a good way.
