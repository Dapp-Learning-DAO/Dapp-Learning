# Bitcoin (BTC)

This repository aims to provide comprehensive information on Bitcoin (BTC) technology, covering its basic functions, advanced applications, and various protocols and tools in its ecosystem. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, this guide will help you gain a deeper understanding and make efficient use of Bitcoin technology.

## Introduction

Bitcoin (BTC), the world's first decentralized cryptocurrency, was introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009 and has had a profound impact on the global financial system. Its main advantages include:

- **Financial Democratization**: Bitcoin enables peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries through decentralized blockchain technology, enhancing individual financial control and freedom.
- **Security and Transparency**: The network employs cryptographic techniques to ensure secure, tamper-proof transactions, with all records being publicly transparent and verifiable by anyone.
- **Limited Supply**: With a capped total supply of 21 million coins, Bitcoin's scarcity makes it an inflation-resistant store of value, often called "digital gold."
- **Global Liquidity**: As a borderless currency, Bitcoin facilitates international transactions and payments.
- **Technological Innovation**: Bitcoin has pioneered blockchain technology, driving the development of smart contracts, decentralized finance (DeFi), and new tech applications.

This knowledge repository will guide you through Bitcoin's basic functionalities, advanced features, and ecosystem applications, helping you stay at the forefront of this rapidly evolving field.
